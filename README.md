Arduino simple 3D scanning control
==================================

A simple arduino based 3D scanning control using a stepper motor and a IR led for shooting an object from different angles with a remote controlled system camera. A image recognition 3D scanning software can then be used for those photos to generate a 3D model. There is no user interface at all. Press reset to restart operation after completion of full rotation, which begins after power up.
